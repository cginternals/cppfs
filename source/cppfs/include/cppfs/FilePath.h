/**
*  @brief
*    Path to file or directory
*
*    This class stores a path to a file or directory and provides common
*    operations like getting the file name or extension.
*
*    FilePath uses a unified format for storing paths that can be used
*    consistently on every platform, using only '/' as a separator.
*    When a FilePath is constructed from a string, the path is translated into
*    the unified format and can then be used in a cross-platform way throughout
*    an application. All operations on FilePath also return paths in the same
*    unified format. To obtain a path in native platform format, use toNative().
*
*    All operations are completely string-based and don't use any system information.
*    Therefore, paths are treated purely syntactically and do not imply that
*    for example a file does really exist.
